# Duck typing

Duck typing in Ruby refers to the practice of treating objects based on their behavior rather than their class or type. If an object responds to certain methods, it can be treated as if it belongs to a specific type. Here are some simple examples of duck typing in Ruby:

# Example:-

class Duck
  def quack
    puts "Quack!"
  end
end

class Dog
  def quack
    puts "Woof!"
  end
end

def make_sound(animal)
  animal.quack
end

duck = Duck.new
dog = Dog.new

make_sound(duck) # Output: Quack!
